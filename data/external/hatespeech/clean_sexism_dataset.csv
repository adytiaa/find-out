4469,spacekatgal it was to get the userbase. and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data.,0

5915,there is currently a vocal male on twitter that claims to be all about anti-harassment. he has defended gamergate in the past.,0
5916,"at this moment in time, i am unaware of any effo he has made into this space. i'm tied in w/many orgs. his name has never once come up.",0
5917,he's been offered contact info from those he's speaking with should he care to contribute. he's utilized none of this. i am unimpressed.,0

5921,"since this was questioned, i should be clear. i'm not talking about suppoers, or just people with opinions.",0
5922,"i'm talking about people that take an active stand to say they want to create solutions for harassment, but do nothing beyond get ed.",0
5923,"for everyone that is involved in this space, there's a huge personal risk. people get targeted. friends and family get targeted.",0
5924,"frankly, it's a little irritating to see some guy with a huge following come along and say ""i'm gonna do stuff!"" and then... do nothing.",0
5925,"or, well, something happened. a hashtag was staed by harassers to suppo him. so, that's something. i guess.",0
